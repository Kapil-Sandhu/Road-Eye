# Road-Eye
RoadEye is a Python-based system for real-time vehicle detection and counting using YOLO and OpenCV. It processes a cropped video region to optimize FPS, detects vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, motorbikes), and counts them as they cross a dynamic line. Features include a yellow crop boundary, adaptive display scaling, and annotated video output.
